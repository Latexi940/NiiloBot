# NiiloBot
<h4>Simple bot for Discord. Mostly just for jokes based on finnish youtuber Niilo22, but also has some functionality with PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds API. Only works on my own server for now!</h4>

<b>Current commands:</b>

<b>>onko (question)</b> &emsp;&emsp;Answers your question like a magic 8-ball

<b>>viisaus</b>&emsp;&emsp; Life "advice"

<b>>rate</b>&emsp;&emsp; Rating

<b>>poistu</b>&emsp; &emsp;Tells bot to leave voice channel

<b>>voiceen</b>&emsp; &emsp;Tells bot to join voice channel

<b>>loki</b>&emsp;&emsp;Starts or stops logging user activity in voice channels

<b>>help</b> &emsp;&emsp;Shows all commands

<b>>pubg [username] [mode]  </b>  &emsp; &emsp; Shows stats from current PUBG season. Modes: solo, duo, squad and last. If no mode is set, combined lifetime stats are shown. 

Just funny voice stuff:

<b>>meetöihin</b>

<b>>syötkeksiä</b>

<b>>huijaus</b>

<b>>blackvelvet</b>

<b>>näin</b>

<b>>nukkunu</b>

<b>>nukkuun</b>

<b>>noniin</b>
