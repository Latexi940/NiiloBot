<h1>Changelog</h1>

>16.12.2020 Initial commit

Bot based on finnish youtuber Niilo22. Mostly just for fun.

>17.12.2020 Some functionalities with PUBG game data using pubg.js

People can now retrieve data about their own game results from the bot.

>18.12.2020 Modified pubg.js

Pubg.js now retrieves lifetime stats instead of seasonal stats. Also added functions to change the log and lobby channel. Bot could now in theory be used in any Discord server.
